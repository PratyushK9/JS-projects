# Random Quote Generator

This web development project involves creating a Random Quote Generator that displays a random quote each time a button is clicked. The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a user-friendly interface. When the user clicks the "Generate Quote" button, a new quote is fetched from a predefined list of quotes or an API and displayed on the screen.

Additionally, the project integrates a "Tweet" button that allows users to share their favorite quotes on Twitter. By clicking this button, users can open a pre-filled tweet with the quote and author, ready to be posted on their Twitter account.

Features:

Random Quote Generation: Displays a random quote each time the button is clicked.
Tweet Functionality: Allows users to tweet the displayed quote directly from the webpage.
Responsive Design: Ensures the application looks good on various devices and screen sizes.
Modern UI/UX: Clean and intuitive interface for an enhanced user experience.
Technologies Used:

-HTML for structuring the content.
-CSS for styling the application.  
-JavaScript for dynamic content generation and functionality.


This project serves as a great exercise in working with APIs, DOM manipulation, and enhancing user interaction with web applications.
